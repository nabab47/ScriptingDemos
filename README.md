# ScriptingDemos
These are all sample programs I have written to display some of the power of scripting a task

You will find 3 demos in this repo.

FIND AND REPLACE: Using scripting and a variant of the sed command to show how simple commands and scripting can make daunting tasks quick and easy. 

PASSWORD PROMPT: Using an expect script to automate the task of inputing passwords during simple tasks such as installing programs.

ALPHABET: Using a Bash script to emulate a children's game. Primarily, this script shows many different aspects of Bash including conditional statements, looping, variables, etc.
